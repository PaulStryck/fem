                         number of vertices an n is the dimension of the space.

                         mesh describes.
                         I.e.,

                         d = 3 => mesh of triangles.

        Caution! Only works for orientable surfaces. Gives garbage results for
        mÃ¶bius strips!

        Create numberings for all topological entities within their dimension.
        I.e., number all vertices from 0 to n, all edges from 0 to m, all faces
        from 0 to l, and so on.

        Also create lookup tables for adjacent, lower dimensional entites in
        all dimensions.
        I.e., Which vertices are the edges made of.
              Which edges are the faces made of,
              Which vertices are the faces made of

        For a 2D simplex Mesh, a global numbering for all vertices, edges and
        faces is needed.
        vertices are numbered implicitly by the order in :param vertices:
        faces are numbered implicitly by the order in :param elements:
        An edge numbering must be created

        For a 1D simplex mesh, the entire numbering is implicitly given.
        Only 0D and 1D numbering is needed. This is contained in :param
        vertices: and :param elements:
